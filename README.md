# Source code of ernestmarcinko.com
 Hi!

 This is the full source code of my [personal website](https://ernestmarcinko.com). It is super simple, mobile friendly static website and scores great on google pagespeed insights too - if that's what you are into.

 It's great for very simple presentation style pages, you only need a web server like Apache or Nginx or anything else.

 ## Features
  - Very simple flex layout
  - SVG social icons
  - Simple parallax effect on the background image
  - Block highlighting on mobile devices when scrolling
  - Fast

 ## Usage
  - You download the code
  - Change it as you like with your favourite editor (or notepad.exe if you are a savage)
    - Don't forget to remove/replace the Google Tag Manager tracking code from **index.html**
    - There is a workflow in **.github/workflows/main.yml** to upload the code via SFTP to the production server on push/PR, you may want to remove that too.
  - Upload to your server
  - Profit?

## Requirements
 - Any web server should do the trick

 ## Q & A
 - Is this simple to use? -> **yes**
 - Does this require PHP? -> **no**
 - Does this require Node? -> **no**
 - Does this require a database? -> **no**
 - Do I need coding knowledge? -> **Some**, but why not start with this simple project?
 - Why don't you use classes or any OOP practices in the script?
    - Because it was simpler this way
 - You are missing Open Graph, SEO etc.. from the code, what the heck? I need my twitter preview pictures.
    - Chill bro, this is just a simple presentation website. Feel free to add these as you need them.
 - What is this good for then? No node.js no PHP, no frameworks, no nothing?
    - But I only wanted a simple website for myself and share it..   
 - My friend can do it better and cheaper
    - But I just... nevermind
 - You are not even a real programmer
    - :(
